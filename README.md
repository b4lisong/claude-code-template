# Claude Code Template

**Professional development setup with Claude Code for systematic, high-quality software development.**

## Summary

A production-ready Claude Code template that transforms your development workflow with TDD-first methodology, automated quality checks, and professional standards. Get from zero to shipping features in under 5 minutes with power commands, git hooks, and multi-language support.

**Value Proposition:** Replace ad-hoc development with systematic workflows that prevent bugs, ensure quality, and accelerate delivery.

**Next Step:** Run the one-line setup below, then start with `/dev "your first feature"` for immediate TDD development.

**Recommended path:** Follow the Quick Start ‚Üí `/dev` workflow ‚Üí `/check` ‚Üí `/ship` cycle for optimal results.

## Quick Start

**Prerequisites:** Install [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code)

### One-Line Setup

```bash
curl -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/orielsanchez/claude-code-template/main/setup.sh | bash
```

**Then start coding:**
```bash
claude                                # Start Claude Code
/dev "implement user authentication"  # Your first TDD feature
```

**Success indicators:** When working, you'll see `[OK]` messages and automatic test execution.

## What You Get

### üéØ **9 Power Commands**
- **`/dev`** - TDD-first development (primary command)
- **`/debug`** - Systematic debugging workflow
- **`/refactor`** - Code improvement with safety nets
- **`/check`** - Quality verification (zero tolerance)
- **`/ship`** - Professional commits
- **`/plan`** - Strategic planning
- **`/help`** - Interactive guidance
- **`/prompt`** - Context handoff
- **`/claude-md`** - Instruction maintenance

### üõ°Ô∏è **Quality Automation**

- **Web search validation** ensures current information

### üìã **Professional Standards**
- **Test-driven development** as the default workflow
- **Zero emoji policy** in code and commits
- **No Claude attribution** in commit messages
- **Systematic debugging** and refactoring processes

## Core Workflow

```bash
/dev "feature name"    # Write tests first, implement with TDD
/check                 # Verify quality (all tests pass, no lint issues)
/ship "description"    # Professional commit with clean history
```

<summary>### Advanced Workflows</summary>

#### Systematic Debugging
```bash
/debug "issue description"  # Structured debugging process
```

#### Code Quality Improvement
```bash
/refactor "component name"  # Safe refactoring with tests
```

#### Strategic Planning
```bash
/plan "project goals"      # Generate development roadmap
```

</details>

## Configuration

The setup script creates:
- `.claude/hooks/smart-lint.sh` - Quality enforcement hooks
- `.claude/settings.json` - Claude Code settings
- Language-specific tooling configurations

## What is Claude Code?

**Claude Code** is an AI-powered CLI that embeds Claude directly into your terminal for agentic development:

- **Full codebase awareness** - Understands your project without manual context
- **Multi-file coordination** - Makes complex changes across files
- **End-to-end workflows** - From tests to commits, all in natural language
- **Works with any editor** - VS Code, JetBrains, Vim, etc.

### Example

Traditional workflow:
```
1. Read docs ‚Üí 2. Write code ‚Üí 3. Debug ‚Üí 4. Repeat...
```

Agentic workflow:
```bash
/dev "user auth with JWT"  # Claude writes tests, implements, validates
/check                     # Quality gates pass automatically  
/ship "add JWT auth"       # Professional commit ready
```

## Alternative Setup

### GitHub Template
1. Click "Use this template" ‚Üí Create repository
2. Clone: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git`
3. Start: `claude` then `/dev "your feature"`

### Existing Project
```bash
# Preserves your existing CLAUDE.md
curl -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/orielsanchez/claude-code-template/main/setup.sh | bash
```
