### What is Claude Code?

**Claude Code** is an AI-powered command-line tool that revolutionizes software development by embedding Claude Opus 4 directly into your terminal. Unlike traditional AI coding assistants that just suggest code, Claude Code is **agentic** - meaning it can:

- **Understand your entire codebase** without manual context selection
- **Make coordinated changes** across multiple files
- **Execute real actions** like running tests, creating commits, and fixing bugs
- **Work directly in your terminal** with VS Code, JetBrains, and other IDEs

### Why Agentic AI Development?

Traditional AI tools require you to copy/paste code and explain context repeatedly. **Agentic AI development** means:

‚úÖ **Full codebase awareness** - Claude understands your project structure, patterns, and dependencies  
‚úÖ **Multi-file coordination** - Make complex changes across multiple files seamlessly  
‚úÖ **End-to-end workflows** - From writing tests to committing code, all in natural language  
‚úÖ **Learning preservation** - Build your skills while building your product

### Quick Example

Instead of this traditional workflow:
```
1. Read documentation 
2. Write code manually
3. Copy/paste to AI for review
4. Manually fix issues
5. Repeat...
```

You get this agentic workflow:
```bash
/dev "user authentication with JWT tokens"
# Claude writes tests first, implements code, runs tests, fixes issues
/check  # Validates quality automatically
/ship "add JWT authentication system"  # Creates commit with docs
```

### Getting Started with Claude Code

**First time?** Install Claude Code:
```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
claude  # Start the interactive session
```

**Then use this template** (instructions below) to get systematic workflows and quality enforcement.
