## Configuration

### Two-File Instruction System

The setup creates a dual-file instruction system for safe template updates:

- **`CLAUDE.md`** - Template instructions (updated with template versions)
  - Core methodology and workflows
  - Universal quality standards
  - Command definitions and patterns
  - Safe to update when template upgrades

- **`PROJECT-SPECIFIC-CLAUDE.md`** - Your project customizations (preserved across updates)
  - Language-specific quality rules
  - Project structure definitions
  - Team standards and practices
  - Learning objectives and skill progression

### Additional Configuration

- `.claude/hooks/smart-lint.sh` - Quality enforcement hooks
- `.claude/settings.json` - Claude Code settings
- Language-specific tooling configurations

## What is Claude Code?

**Claude Code** is an AI-powered CLI that embeds Claude directly into your terminal for agentic development:

- **Full codebase awareness** - Understands your project without manual context
- **Multi-file coordination** - Makes complex changes across files
- **End-to-end workflows** - From tests to commits, all in natural language
- **Works with any editor** - VS Code, JetBrains, Vim, etc.

### Example

Traditional workflow:
```
1. Read docs ‚Üí 2. Write code ‚Üí 3. Debug ‚Üí 4. Repeat...
```

Agentic workflow:
```bash
/dev "user auth with JWT"  # Claude writes tests, implements, validates
/check                     # Quality gates pass automatically  
/ship "add JWT auth"       # Professional commit ready
```

## Alternative Setup

### GitHub Template
1. Click "Use this template" ‚Üí Create repository
2. Clone: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git`
3. Start: `claude` then `/dev "your feature"`

### Existing Project
```bash
# Preserves your existing project customizations
curl -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/b4lisong/claude-code-template/main/setup.sh | bash
```

### Project Customization
After setup, customize `PROJECT-SPECIFIC-CLAUDE.md` for your project:
```bash
claude                           # Start Claude Code
/claude-md create-project        # Set up project customizations
/claude-md update-mastery        # Track your learning goals
```

## Template Updates & Migration

### ü§ñ **AI-Powered Template Updates**

Updating to the latest template features is seamless with intelligent AI migration that preserves all your project customizations:

```bash
# Update existing project to latest template
curl -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/b4lisong/claude-code-template/main/setup.sh | bash
```

### **Interactive Migration Process**

When customizations are detected, you'll see three migration options:

**Option 1: AI Extraction (Recommended)** üéØ
- Claude Code AI analyzes your old customizations
- Intelligently extracts and categorizes project-specific content  
- Generates properly formatted PROJECT-SPECIFIC-CLAUDE.md
- Shows preview before applying changes
- Most reliable method with natural language understanding

**Option 2: Manual Migration** üìã
- Creates PROJECT-SPECIFIC-CLAUDE.md template
- Preserves backup of your old customizations
- Guide manual transfer of custom rules and settings

**Option 3: Skip Migration** ‚è≠Ô∏è
- Updates template only, migrate customizations later
- Use `/claude-md extract-ai <backup_file>` when ready

### **AI Migration Advantages**

‚úÖ **Context Understanding** - AI grasps intent behind customizations, not just text patterns  
‚úÖ **Complete Extraction** - Captures complex nested customizations and unexpected formats  
‚úÖ **Smart Categorization** - Places content in appropriate PROJECT-SPECIFIC-CLAUDE.md sections  
‚úÖ **Proper Formatting** - Generates correctly structured output with preserved meaning  
‚úÖ **Safe Process** - Always shows preview and requires confirmation before applying  

### **Migration Safety Features**

üõ°Ô∏è **Multiple Backups** - Timestamped backups created automatically  
üõ°Ô∏è **Preview System** - See exactly what will be migrated before confirming  
üõ°Ô∏è **Graceful Fallbacks** - If AI extraction fails, fallback to manual migration  
üõ°Ô∏è **Recovery Options** - Original backups always preserved for manual restoration  
üõ°Ô∏è **Validation Checks** - Ensures extracted content is properly formatted  

### **Manual AI Extraction**

You can also run AI extraction manually on any backup file:

```bash
claude                                           # Start Claude Code
/extract-customizations CLAUDE.md.backup-file   # AI extract from backup
/claude-md extract-ai CLAUDE.md.backup-file     # Alternative command
```

### **What Gets Migrated**

The AI extraction intelligently identifies and migrates:
- **Language-specific quality rules** (TypeScript, Python, Rust, etc.)
- **Project structure definitions** and naming conventions  
- **Team standards and practices** (code review, deployment)
- **Learning objectives** and skill progression tracking
- **Domain-specific requirements** (compliance, performance)
- **Custom quality gates** and validation rules

### **Update Workflow Example**

```bash
# Run template update
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/b4lisong/claude-code-template/main/setup.sh | bash

# Interactive options appear:
# [1] AI Extraction (Recommended)
# [2] Manual Migration  
# [3] Skip Migration

# Choose AI extraction:
# ‚úÖ Backup created: CLAUDE.md.backup-20250106-143022
# ‚úÖ AI analyzing customizations...
# ‚úÖ Preview of extracted content shown
# ‚úÖ Confirm migration: Y
# ‚úÖ Migration complete! Two-file system ready.

# Resume development:
claude
/dev "new feature with latest template"
```
