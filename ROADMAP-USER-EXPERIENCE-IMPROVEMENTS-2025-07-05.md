## Success Metrics

```
Metric                    | Current | Target
--------------------------|---------|--------
Setup Success Rate       | TBD     | 95%
Time to First Success     | TBD     | < 5 min
Command Discovery Rate    | TBD     | 80%
User Satisfaction        | TBD     | 8.5/10
Help Usage Engagement    | TBD     | +40%
```

## Implementation Dependencies

```
Phase 1 (Research)
    |
    +-- Phase 2 (Quick Wins) -- Can start partially in parallel
            |
            +-- Phase 3 (Interactive) -- Depends on Phase 2 foundation
                    |
                    +-- Phase 4 (Accessibility) -- Can run parallel to Phase 3
                            |
                            +-- Phase 5 (Validation) -- Requires all previous phases
```

---

## Resource Requirements

- **UX Research**: Survey design, user interviews, data analysis
- **Development**: Command system enhancement, setup wizard, interactive features
- **Design**: Visual improvements, theming system, accessibility compliance
- **Testing**: User testing sessions, accessibility testing, performance validation
- **Documentation**: Updated guides, tutorials, help system content

---

## Risk Mitigation Strategy

1. **Assumption Validation**: Start with user research to validate all assumptions
2. **Incremental Implementation**: Deploy changes incrementally with rollback capability
3. **Backwards Compatibility**: Maintain compatibility throughout all phases
4. **Regular Feedback**: User feedback checkpoints to course-correct early
5. **Performance Monitoring**: Ensure improvements don't degrade performance
