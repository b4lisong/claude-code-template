## Success Metrics

```
Metric                    | Current | Target
--------------------------|---------|--------
Setup Success Rate       | TBD     | 95%
Time to First Success     | TBD     | < 5 min
Command Discovery Rate    | TBD     | 80%
User Satisfaction        | TBD     | 8.5/10

## Implementation Dependencies

```
Phase 1 (Research)
    |
    +-- Phase 2 (Quick Wins) -- Can start partially in parallel
            |
            +-- Phase 3 (Interactive) -- Depends on Phase 2 foundation
                    |
                    +-- Phase 4 (Accessibility) -- Can run parallel to Phase 3
                            |
                            +-- Phase 5 (Validation) -- Requires all previous phases
```
