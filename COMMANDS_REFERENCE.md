**Example:** `/agents` (opens sub-agent interface)  
**What it does:**
- Create and configure specialized sub-agents
- Delegate complex tasks to focused agents
- Coordinate multi-agent workflows
- Access template-specific agents (TDD-Coach, Quality-Enforcer, Strategic-Planner, Refactoring-Specialist)

## üìÅ Two-File Instruction System

The template uses a dual-file system for safe template updates:

### CLAUDE.md (Template Instructions)
- Core methodology and workflows
- Universal quality standards  
- Command definitions and patterns
- **Safe to update** when template upgrades

### PROJECT-SPECIFIC-CLAUDE.md (Your Customizations)  
- Language-specific quality rules
- Project structure definitions
- Team standards and practices
- Learning objectives and skill progression
- **Preserved across template updates**

### File Management Workflow
```
/claude-md create-project      # Set up project customizations
/claude-md backup             # Backup before major changes
/claude-md update-mastery     # Track learning progress weekly
/claude-md merge-customizations # Migrate old customizations
```

## üéØ Quick Workflows

### Standard Development Flow
```
/dev "new feature"     # TDD implementation
/check                 # Verify quality
/ship "add feature"    # Commit changes
```

### Bug Fix Flow
```
/debug "error description"   # Find and fix
/check                      # Verify fix
/ship "fix: error"         # Commit fix
```

### Refactoring Flow
```
/check                     # Ensure tests pass
/refactor "component"      # Improve code
/check                     # Verify nothing broke
/ship "refactor: component" # Commit improvements
```

### Sub-Agent Workflow Examples
```
/agents                    # Open sub-agent interface
# Use TDD-Coach for complex test design
# Use Quality-Enforcer for parallel issue fixing  
# Use Strategic-Planner for comprehensive roadmaps
# Use Refactoring-Specialist for safe code improvements
```

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Always start with `/dev`** for new features - TDD prevents bugs
2. **Run `/check` before `/ship`** - Ensure quality standards
3. **Use `/plan` for complex features** - Break down before building
4. **Customize PROJECT-SPECIFIC-CLAUDE.md** - Add your project's specific needs
5. **Run `/claude-md backup`** - Before major instruction changes
6. **Update `/claude-md update-mastery`** - Weekly learning progress tracking
7. **Use `/agents` for complex tasks** - Delegate to specialized sub-agents

## üö´ Command Guidelines

- **NO emojis** in commits (enforced by hooks)
- **NO Claude attribution** in messages
- **Always delete old code** when replacing
- **Exit code 2** means issues found - fix before continuing

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Hook Failures
If `/check` keeps failing:
1. Run the specific linter manually
2. Fix all reported issues
3. Re-run `/check`

### Command Not Found
Ensure you're in a Claude Code session and the template is properly installed.

### Quality Check Issues
- **TypeScript:** Fix type errors with `tsc --noEmit`
- **ESLint:** Auto-fix with `eslint . --fix`
- **Prettier:** Format with `prettier --write .`
- **Python:** Format with `black .`
- **Rust:** Format with `cargo fmt`
