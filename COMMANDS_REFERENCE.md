## üìÅ Two-File Instruction System

The template uses a dual-file system for safe template updates:

### CLAUDE.md (Template Instructions)
- Core methodology and workflows
- Universal quality standards  
- Command definitions and patterns
- **Safe to update** when template upgrades

### PROJECT-SPECIFIC-CLAUDE.md (Your Customizations)  
- Language-specific quality rules
- Project structure definitions
- Team standards and practices
- Learning objectives and skill progression
- **Preserved across template updates**

### File Management Workflow
```
/claude-md create-project      # Set up project customizations
/claude-md backup             # Backup before major changes
/claude-md update-mastery     # Track learning progress weekly
/claude-md merge-customizations # Migrate old customizations
```

## üéØ Quick Workflows

### Standard Development Flow
```
/dev "new feature"     # TDD implementation
/check                 # Verify quality
/ship "add feature"    # Commit changes
```

### Bug Fix Flow
```
/debug "error description"   # Find and fix
/check                      # Verify fix
/ship "fix: error"         # Commit fix
```

### Refactoring Flow
```
/check                     # Ensure tests pass
/refactor "component"      # Improve code
/check                     # Verify nothing broke
/ship "refactor: component" # Commit improvements
```

### Sub-Agent Workflow Examples
```
/agents                    # Open sub-agent interface
# Use TDD-Coach for complex test design
# Use Quality-Enforcer for parallel issue fixing  
# Use Strategic-Planner for comprehensive roadmaps
# Use Refactoring-Specialist for safe code improvements
```

### Template Update Workflows

#### AI-Powered Template Update (Recommended)
```bash
# Update existing project with AI migration
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/b4lisong/claude-code-template/main/setup.sh | bash

# Interactive process:
# [1] AI Extraction (Recommended) ‚Üê Choose this
# ‚úÖ Backup created automatically
# ‚úÖ AI analyzes your customizations  
# ‚úÖ Preview extracted content
# ‚úÖ Confirm migration: Y
# ‚úÖ Migration complete!

# Resume development with latest features:
claude
/dev "new feature with updated template"
```

#### Manual AI Extraction
```bash
# Extract customizations from backup manually
claude                                        # Start Claude Code
/extract-customizations backup-file.md       # AI extract from backup
# Preview shown ‚Üí Confirm ‚Üí Applied

# Alternative command:
/claude-md extract-ai backup-file.md         # Same AI extraction
```

#### Template Update with Manual Migration
```bash
# Update template, migrate customizations manually
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/b4lisong/claude-code-template/main/setup.sh | bash

# Choose option [2] Manual Migration
# ‚úÖ PROJECT-SPECIFIC-CLAUDE.md template created
# ‚úÖ Your backup preserved: CLAUDE.md.backup-file

# Manually migrate your customizations:
/claude-md merge-customizations              # Get migration guidance
```

#### Recovery from Backup
```bash  
# Restore customizations from old backup
claude
/extract-customizations old-backup.md       # AI extract from any backup
# Or manually restore specific sections to PROJECT-SPECIFIC-CLAUDE.md
```

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Always start with `/dev`** for new features - TDD prevents bugs
2. **Run `/check` before `/ship`** - Ensure quality standards
3. **Use `/plan` for complex features** - Break down before building
4. **Use AI extraction for template updates** - More reliable than manual migration
5. **Customize PROJECT-SPECIFIC-CLAUDE.md** - Add your project's specific needs
6. **Run `/claude-md backup`** - Before major instruction changes
7. **Update `/claude-md update-mastery`** - Weekly learning progress tracking
8. **Preview AI extractions** - Always review before confirming migrations
9. **Use `/agents` for complex tasks** - Delegate to specialized sub-agents

## üö´ Command Guidelines

- **NO emojis** in commits (enforced by hooks)
- **NO Claude attribution** in messages
- **Always delete old code** when replacing
- **Exit code 2** means issues found - fix before continuing

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Hook Failures
If `/check` keeps failing:
1. Run the specific linter manually
2. Fix all reported issues
3. Re-run `/check`

### Command Not Found
Ensure you're in a Claude Code session and the template is properly installed.

### Quality Check Issues
- **TypeScript:** Fix type errors with `tsc --noEmit`
- **ESLint:** Auto-fix with `eslint . --fix`
- **Prettier:** Format with `prettier --write .`
- **Python:** Format with `black .`
- **Rust:** Format with `cargo fmt`
