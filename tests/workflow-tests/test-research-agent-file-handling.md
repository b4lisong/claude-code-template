# Research Agent File Handling Test

**Purpose**: Validate that research agent file generation workflow works correctly

## Test Case 1: Research Agent File Generation Workflow

### Setup
- Use Task tool with any research agent
- Request file generation  
- Follow corrected workflow

### Expected Behavior
1. Research agent generates response with file content in artifacts
2. No file is created on filesystem automatically  
3. Manual file creation using Write tool succeeds
4. File verification confirms filesystem presence

### Test Steps
1. Execute: `Task with [Research Agent] -> request file generation`
2. Verify: Agent response contains file content but no filesystem file
3. Execute: `Write tool with agent-generated content`  
4. Verify: `ls` or `find` confirms file exists on filesystem

### Success Criteria
- ✅ Agent provides comprehensive content
- ❌ No automatic file creation occurs  
- ✅ Manual Write tool creates file successfully
- ✅ File exists and contains expected content

## Test Case 2: Prevent False Positive Detection

### Purpose
Ensure we don't mistake agent response artifacts for actual files

### Test Steps  
1. Use research agent to "create" file with unique name
2. Verify agent claims success
3. Verify filesystem shows no such file exists
4. Document that agent responses are simulations only

### Success Criteria
- Agent response shows file creation syntax
- Filesystem verification confirms no file created
- Clear distinction between simulated and actual file operations

## Regression Protection

This test prevents regression to assuming research agents create actual files.

**Before Fix**: Assumed agent responses created files, leading to missing documentation  
**After Fix**: Clear workflow requires manual file creation after agent content generation
