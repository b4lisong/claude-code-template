# Claude Code Research Plans

This directory contains detailed research plans and analyses generated by Claude Code sub-agents. All sub-agents in this project operate as **researchers rather than implementers** - they analyze, investigate, and create comprehensive plans that human developers can execute.

## Directory Structure

- **`tdd-research/`** - Test-driven development strategies and testing plans
- **`quality-analysis/`** - Code quality assessments and improvement plans  
- **`strategic-research/`** - Project architecture and strategic planning documents
- **`refactoring-analysis/`** - Code improvement opportunities and refactoring plans
- **`documentation-research/`** - External documentation research and integration guides
- **`templates/`** - Standardized plan templates for consistent output

## Naming Convention

All plan files follow this format:
```
{agent-type}-{brief-description}-{YYYY-MM-DD}.md
```

**Examples:**
- `tdd-research-authentication-system-2025-01-15.md`
- `quality-analysis-eslint-issues-2025-01-15.md`
- `strategic-research-microservices-migration-2025-01-15.md`
- `refactoring-analysis-payment-module-2025-01-15.md`
- `documentation-research-stripe-api-2025-01-15.md`

## Research-Only Philosophy

**ALL sub-agents in this project follow a strict research-only approach:**

1. **NEVER implement code changes directly**
2. **CREATE comprehensive, actionable plans**
3. **PROVIDE evidence-based recommendations**
4. **DOCUMENT research methodology and findings**
5. **ENABLE informed implementation decisions**

## Workflow Integration

### Standard Process:
1. **Research Phase** - Sub-agent investigates and analyzes (including external documentation for integrations)
2. **Planning Phase** - Sub-agent creates comprehensive plan with implementation guidance
3. **Documentation Phase** - Plan saved to appropriate subdirectory with clear source attribution
4. **Review Phase** - Human developer reviews and approves plan
5. **Implementation Phase** - Human developer executes based on research-backed recommendations

### Quality Standards

All research plans must include:
- **Executive Summary** - High-level overview and key findings
- **Research Methodology** - How the analysis was conducted
- **Current State Analysis** - What was discovered
- **Recommendations** - Evidence-based suggestions
- **Implementation Steps** - Detailed, actionable guidance
- **Success Criteria** - How to measure successful execution
- **Risk Assessment** - Potential challenges and mitigation strategies

## Benefits of Research-First Approach

- **Better Planning** - Comprehensive research before implementation
- **Knowledge Preservation** - All analysis and reasoning documented
- **Quality Decisions** - Evidence-based implementation choices
- **Team Collaboration** - Plans can be reviewed and shared
- **Risk Mitigation** - Issues identified before coding begins

This approach ensures that all implementation work is based on thorough research and careful planning, leading to better outcomes and fewer surprises during development.
