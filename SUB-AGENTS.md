# Sub-Agents Guide: Specialized Research AI for Complex Development Analysis

This Claude Code template includes five specialized research sub-agents designed to analyze complex development challenges and create comprehensive plans while maintaining the template's core values: research-first approach, evidence-based recommendations, and systematic analysis methodologies.

## What Are Research Sub-Agents?

Research sub-agents are specialized AI assistants that:
- **Analyze and research** rather than implement directly
- **Create comprehensive plans** saved to `/plans` directory for human execution
- **Operate in separate context windows** with specialized research prompts
- **Focus on evidence-based recommendations** backed by thorough analysis
- **Coordinate research efforts** across multiple domains and expertise areas

**IMPORTANT: All sub-agents are RESEARCHERS, not implementers.** They create detailed research plans that you review and execute.

**Access via:** `/agents` command to open sub-agent management interface
