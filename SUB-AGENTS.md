# Sub-Agents Guide: Specialized AI for Complex Development Tasks

This Claude Code template includes four specialized sub-agents designed to handle complex, multi-step development tasks while maintaining the template's core values: TDD-first development, zero-tolerance quality standards, and systematic learning approaches.

## What Are Sub-Agents?

Sub-agents are specialized AI assistants that:
- Operate in separate context windows
- Have customized system prompts for specific domains
- Can be configured with specific tool access
- Proactively delegate tasks based on expertise
- Coordinate with the main conversation and other agents

**Access via:** `/agents` command to open sub-agent management interface

- **RED Phase:** Write comprehensive failing tests that define exact behavior
- **GREEN Phase:** Guide minimal implementation to pass tests  
- **REFACTOR Phase:** Improve code quality with test safety net
- **Learning:** Explain the "why" behind every TDD decision

### **When to Use**
```bash
# Complex feature with multiple test scenarios
"Use the TDD-Coach agent to design comprehensive tests for this authentication system"

# When TDD workflow is unclear
"TDD-Coach agent: guide me through testing this payment processing module"

# Building TDD skills
"TDD-Coach agent: explain why we write tests first for this user management feature"
```

### **Quality Standards Enforced**
- Implementation never before tests
- Tests define behavior, not implementation details
- Comprehensive coverage of happy path, edge cases, errors
- Clear, readable tests that serve as documentation

### **Integration Points**

## Multi-Agent Coordination Patterns

### **Development Workflow Enhancement**
```bash
# Start complex feature development
/agents
# Delegate to TDD-Coach for comprehensive test design
# Use Quality-Enforcer for continuous quality maintenance
# Strategic-Planner for architectural decisions
/dev "enterprise authentication system"
/check  # Quality-Enforcer ensures everything passes
/ship "add enterprise auth with SSO support"
```

### **Quality-First Development**
```bash
# Parallel quality and development
/agents
# TDD-Coach designs tests
# Quality-Enforcer maintains standards
# Development proceeds with dual safety nets
```

### **Strategic Refactoring**
```bash
# Complex refactoring project  
/agents
# Strategic-Planner creates refactoring roadmap
# Refactoring-Specialist executes safely
# Quality-Enforcer ensures standards maintained
# TDD-Coach maintains test coverage
```

## Best Practices for Sub-Agent Usage

### **When to Delegate to Sub-Agents**
- **Complex Tasks:** Multi-step processes requiring specialized expertise

- **Specialized Knowledge:** Domain-specific requirements (TDD, quality, planning, refactoring)
- **Quality Assurance:** Tasks requiring zero-tolerance standards
- **Learning Opportunities:** Situations where specialized coaching adds value

### **Coordination Strategies**
- **Clear Task Boundaries:** Define specific responsibilities for each agent
- **Communication Protocols:** Ensure agents report back key insights
- **Quality Consistency:** All agents must maintain template quality standards
- **Learning Integration:** Use agent interactions as learning opportunities

- **Refactoring-Specialist:** Ensures behavior preservation during improvement

## Getting Started with Sub-Agents

### **Step 1: Access Sub-Agents**
```bash
/agents  # Opens sub-agent management interface
```

### **Step 2: Understand Available Agents**
Review the four template agents and their specializations:
- TDD-Coach for test-driven development
- Quality-Enforcer for issue resolution  
- Strategic-Planner for comprehensive planning
- Refactoring-Specialist for safe code improvement

### **Step 3: Strategic Delegation**
Choose agents based on task complexity and domain requirements:

## Advanced Usage Patterns

### **Multi-Agent Project Workflow**
```bash
# Phase 1: Strategic Planning
Strategic-Planner agent: "Create comprehensive roadmap for user management system"

# Phase 2: TDD Implementation  
TDD-Coach agent: "Design tests for user registration, authentication, and profile management"

# Phase 3: Quality Assurance
Quality-Enforcer agent: "Ensure all code meets production standards"

# Phase 4: Code Improvement
Refactoring-Specialist agent: "Optimize user service architecture"
```

### **Continuous Quality Development**
```bash
# Ongoing quality partnership
Quality-Enforcer agent: "Monitor and fix issues as they arise"
TDD-Coach agent: "Maintain test-first approach throughout development"
# Main conversation handles feature logic with specialist support
```

### **Learning-Accelerated Development**
```bash
# Use agents as teachers
TDD-Coach agent: "Explain TDD decisions while implementing authentication"
Refactoring-Specialist agent: "Show me refactoring patterns while improving code quality"
Strategic-Planner agent: "Teach planning methodology while creating roadmaps"
```

## Conclusion

The template's sub-agents transform individual development into coordinated team development, with each agent bringing specialized expertise while maintaining the template's core values:

- **TDD-first philosophy** preserved and enhanced
- **Quality standards** enforced across all agents
- **Professional output** maintained in all interactions
- **Learning opportunities** multiplied through specialized coaching
- **Systematic approaches** applied to complex problems

Use sub-agents strategically to handle complexity while building your own systematic thinking skills. The goal is not dependency on AI agents, but leveraging them to become a better, more systematic developer yourself.

**Remember:** Sub-agents are tools to enhance your capabilities and accelerate your learning, not replace your thinking. Use them wisely to build senior-level development skills while maintaining the template's commitment to quality and systematic approaches.
